# Project Proposal Submitted

### Brief description about your idea
It can easily be taken as OLX exclusively for books. If someone has some books and want to sell them, he’ll place an ad on the app and the desired people will contact him. And if someone wants to buy any book, he can also place an ad to ask people if someone has this book to sell.

Not only buying and selling, people will be able to exchange books.

#### How will you cover/map all the mandatory requirements in your project? Describe each one below
1. Social Media Integration like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc (Retrieve and post data ) – at least
   - posted ads can be shared on Facebook and Twitter and the responses (comments/messages) can be brought to the app
2. Google Maps
   - The location the individual posting the ad can be shared and viewed by the interested people
3. Local Database and Content Provider
   - The database of books as well as people profiles will be maintained
4. Calls, SMS, Email
   - One will be able to communicate directly with ad poster via this app
5. Interaction with hardware like Camera, GPS, Vibrator, Sensors etc
   - Camera can be used to take picture of the book to be bought or sell
   - GPS can be used to take an individual to the desired location to exchange book(s) with someone
6. Ads
   - Ads will be posted at the bottom of the app via Ad Mob
7. Management of your Database on the server and accessing your online database from your android app (whenever internet access is available)
   - All the data (e.g. books and user profiles) will be stored online. When application start it look for data online and then store it locally for displaying. If internet is not available, it looks for data stored locally
8. Professional and Attractive User Interface
Pull-To-Refresh: Implement Pull-To-Refresh mechanism in your application where needed – Use of SwipeRefreshLayout
9. Bug-Sense Integration Maintain log of all the crashes/exceptions/errors using bug-sense.
Your application should detect crashing/exception and gracefully terminate without showing a crashing dialog/message to user which leaves a bad impression.
10. Google Analytics Integrate Google Analytics with your application.
